### Autonomous Agent Architecture

The system operates as an intelligent agent with the following layers:

1. **Perception Layer**: Multi-source data ingestion and real-time monitoring
2. **Reasoning Layer**: Policy-based decision making with confidence scoring
3. **Action Layer**: Autonomous optimization and alerting with guardrails
4. **Learning Layer**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops

## Mathematical Models and Algorithms

### 1. Capacity Utilization Analysis

**Peak Traffic Detection Formula:**
```
Utilization(t) = Flights_in_window(t) / Runway_Capacity(t)
Peak_Score = max(Utilization(t)) * Duration_Factor * Consistency_Factor
```

**Overload Detection:**
```
Overload_Threshold = 1.0 (100% capacity)
Critical_Threshold = 1.2 (120% capacity)
Overload_Duration = time_window where Utilization(t) > Threshold
```

### 2. Delay Risk Prediction

**Risk Score Calculation:**
```
Risk_Score = Σ(Feature_Weight_i * Feature_Value_i)
Features: [historical_delay, weather_impact, traffic_density, aircraft_type, airline_punctuality]
Confidence = Model_Probability * Data_Quality_Factor
```

**Cascade Impact Modeling:**
```
Cascade_Score = Initial_Delay * Propagation_Factor * Network_Connectivity
Downstream_Impact = Σ(Connected_Flight_Delays * Importance_Weight)
```

### 3. Schedule Optimization

**Multi-Criteria Objective Function:**
```
Minimize: α*Total_Delay + β*Fuel_Cost + γ*Fairness_Penalty + δ*Curfew_Violations

Where:
- α, β, γ, δ are configurable weights
- Total_Delay = Σ(departure_delay + arrival_delay)
- Fairness_Penalty = Variance(airline_delays)
- Curfew_Violations = Count(flights_after_curfew) * penalty_weight
```

**Constraint Satisfaction:**
```
Subject to:
- Runway_Capacity(t) ≥ Scheduled_Flights(t) ∀t
- Minimum_Turnaround_Time ≤ Aircraft_Ground_Time
- Gate_Availability(t) ≥ Required_Gates(t)
- Crew_Duty_Limits respected
```

### 4. Weather Impact Modeling

**Capacity Adjustment Formula:**
```
Adjusted_Capacity = Base_Capacity * Weather_Multiplier(regime)

Weather_Multipliers:
- Calm: 1.0 (no reduction)
- Medium: 0.9 (10% reduction)
- Strong: 0.7 (30% reduction)  
- Severe: 0.5 (50% reduction)
```

**Weather Transition Probability:**
```
P(Weather_t+1 | Weather_t) = Transition_Matrix[current_regime][next_regime]
Expected_Duration = 1 / (1 - P(same_regime))
```

### 5. Autonomous Decision Confidence

**Confidence Score Calculation:**
```
Confidence = Data_Quality * Threshold_Exceedance * Historical_Accuracy * Model_Certainty

Where:
- Data_Quality = min(1.0, Available_Flights / Expected_Flights)
- Threshold_Exceedance = (Observed_Value - Threshold) / Threshold
- Historical_Accuracy = Past_Correct_Decisions / Total_Past_Decisions
- Model_Certainty = 1 - Prediction_Variance
```

**Policy Trigger Logic:**
```
Trigger_Decision = (Condition_Met AND Confidence > Min_Threshold AND 
                   Time_Since_Last_Action > Cooldown_Period AND
                   Guardrail_Checks_Passed)
```
