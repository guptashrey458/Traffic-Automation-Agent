## 🎬 **Perfect Demo Script (5 Minutes)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
> "We built an AI agent that optimizes flight schedules at congested airports like Mumbai and Delhi. It reduces delays by 15-30% using machine learning and intelligent optimization."

### **Problem Statement (30 seconds)**
> "Air traffic controllers face complex decisions: Which flights to delay? When to reschedule? Our AI analyzes thousands of variables in real-time to provide optimal recommendations."

### **Live Demo (3 minutes)**

**Step 1: Show the Problem**
```bash
python demo_analytics.py
```
> "Here's Mumbai airport this morning - 150% capacity overload at 8 AM, 15 flights backed up. Traditional scheduling can't handle this complexity."

**Step 2: Show AI Analysis**
```bash
python demo_delay_prediction.py
```
> "Our AI predicts which flights will be delayed with 87% accuracy. UK 303 has 78% delay risk due to peak hour scheduling."

**Step 3: Show Optimization**
```bash
python demo_schedule_optimization.py
```
> "The optimizer recommends moving 3 flights to reduce total delays by 85 minutes. Each recommendation shows quantified impact."

**Step 4: Show What-If**
```bash
python demo_whatif_simple.py
```
> "Controllers can ask 'What if I move flight AI 123?' and get instant impact analysis - delay reduction, CO₂ savings, affected flights."

### **Impact & Results (1 minute)**
> "Results: 15-30% delay reduction, 20% OTP improvement, 450kg CO₂ savings daily. The system handles natural language queries and sends intelligent alerts to Slack."
