# Agentic Flight Scheduler - Project Completion Summary

## Project Overview

The Agentic Flight Scheduler is a comprehensive autonomous flight scheduling optimization system that has been successfully completed with all 18 planned tasks implemented. The system combines machine learning, optimization algorithms, natural language processing, and intelligent automation to provide autonomous flight schedule management for busy aviation hubs.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Mathematical Models

#### 1. Capacity Utilization Analysis
```
Utilization(t) = Flights_in_window(t) / Runway_Capacity(t)
Peak_Score = max(Utilization(t)) * Duration_Factor * Consistency_Factor
Overload_Detection = time_window where Utilization(t) > 1.0
```

#### 2. Delay Risk Prediction
```
Risk_Score = Σ(Feature_Weight_i * Feature_Value_i)
Confidence = Model_Probability * Data_Quality_Factor
Features: [historical_delay, weather_impact, traffic_density, aircraft_type, airline_punctuality]
```

#### 3. Multi-Criteria Schedule Optimization
```
Minimize: α*Total_Delay + β*Fuel_Cost + γ*Fairness_Penalty + δ*Curfew_Violations

Subject to:
- Runway_Capacity(t) ≥ Scheduled_Flights(t) ∀t
- Minimum_Turnaround_Time ≤ Aircraft_Ground_Time
- Gate_Availability(t) ≥ Required_Gates(t)
```

#### 4. Weather Impact Modeling
```
Adjusted_Capacity = Base_Capacity * Weather_Multiplier(regime)
Weather_Multipliers: {Calm: 1.0, Medium: 0.9, Strong: 0.7, Severe: 0.5}
```

#### 5. Autonomous Decision Confidence
```
Confidence = Data_Quality * Threshold_Exceedance * Historical_Accuracy * Model_Certainty
Trigger_Decision = (Condition_Met AND Confidence > Min_Threshold AND 
                   Time_Since_Last_Action > Cooldown_Period AND
                   Guardrail_Checks_Passed)
```
