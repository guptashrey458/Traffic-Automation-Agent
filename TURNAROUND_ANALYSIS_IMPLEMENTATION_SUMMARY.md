# Turnaround Time Analysis Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Task 7: "Implement turnaround time analysis" from the agentic flight scheduler specification. This implementation provides comprehensive turnaround time analysis capabilities for same-tail operations, including P90 quantile estimation, taxi time prediction, and departure slot validation.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Service: `TurnaroundAnalysisService`

**Key Features:**
- Turnaround time estimation for same-tail operations
- P90 quantile estimation for turnaround times  
- Taxi time estimation functions (EXOT/EXIN)
- Departure slot feasibility validation
- Risk assessment for tight turnarounds

**Main Methods:**
- `estimate_turnaround_time()` - Calculates P50/P90/P95 turnaround percentiles
- `predict_taxi_time()` - Estimates taxi times for departures/arrivals
- `validate_departure_slot()` - Validates feasibility of proposed departure times

### 2. Data Models

#### `TurnaroundEstimate`
- P50, P90, P95 turnaround time percentiles
- Historical context (sample size, min/max observed)
- Aircraft type and route type classification
- Confidence level assessment
- Feasibility checking methods

#### `TaxiTimeEstimate`  
- Expected and P90/P95 taxi time estimates
- Operation type (departure/arrival)
- Congestion and weather impact factors
- Terminal distance considerations

#### `TurnaroundValidation`
- Comprehensive departure slot validation
- Risk level assessment (low/medium/high/critical)
- Feasibility checks for P90 and P95 thresholds
- Recommended departure times when needed
- Risk factor identification

### 3. Enhanced Delay Prediction Service
**File:** `src/services/delay_prediction.py`

**Additions:**
- Integrated turnaround time estimation methods
- Enhanced taxi time prediction capabilities
- Fallback prediction methods for when ML models unavailable
- Aircraft type extraction from registration numbers

## Key Capabilities

### Turnaround Time Analysis
- **Historical Data Integration:** Queries database for same-tail turnaround patterns
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculates P50, P90, P95 percentiles from historical data
- **Default Estimates:** Provides aircraft-specific defaults when historical data insufficient
- **Route Type Classification:** Distinguishes domestic vs international operations

### Taxi Time Prediction (EXOT/EXIN)
- **Airport-Specific Estimates:** Different taxi times for major airports (BOM, DEL, BLR)
- **Operation Type Aware:** Separate estimates for departures vs arrivals
- **Runway-Specific:** Considers specific runway assignments
- **Weather/Congestion Factors:** Placeholder for future enhancements

### Departure Slot Validation
- **Same-Tail Tracking:** Finds previous arrival flights for same aircraft
- **Feasibility Assessment:** Checks against P90 and P95 turnaround thresholds
- **Risk Classification:** Four-level risk assessment (low/medium/high/critical)
- **Recommendations:** Suggests alternative departure times when needed

## Default Values

## Usage Examples

### Basic Turnaround Estimation
```python
from src.services.turnaround_analysis import TurnaroundAnalysisService

service = TurnaroundAnalysisService()
estimate = service.estimate_turnaround_time("VT-EXA", "BOM")

print(f"P90 Turnaround: {estimate.p90_turnaround_minutes} minutes")
print(f"Confidence: {estimate.confidence_level}")
```

### Departure Slot Validation
```python
validation = service.validate_departure_slot(
    departure_flight, 
    proposed_departure_time, 
    previous_arrival_flight
)

if not validation.is_feasible_p90:
    print(f"Risk: {validation.risk_level}")
    print(f"Recommended: {validation.recommended_departure_time}")
```

### Taxi Time Prediction
```python
taxi_estimate = service.predict_taxi_time(flight, "09R")
print(f"Expected taxi: {taxi_estimate.expected_taxi_minutes} minutes")
print(f"P90 taxi: {taxi_estimate.p90_taxi_minutes} minutes")
