# Peak Traffic Analysis Engine - Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: 5. Implement peak traffic analysis engine

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive peak traffic analysis engine for the Agentic Flight Scheduler system. The implementation includes all required sub-tasks and meets the specified requirements.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. AnalyticsEngine Class (`src/services/analytics.py`)
- **Core functionality**: Peak detection algorithms for airport traffic analysis
- **Time bucketing**: Configurable time intervals (5-min, 10-min, 15-min, 30-min)
- **Demand vs capacity calculation**: Real-time utilization and overload detection
- **Weather regime support**: Capacity adjustments for different weather conditions
- **Heatmap generation**: Visualization-ready data structures

#### 2. Supporting Data Models
- **TimeBucket**: Represents traffic data for specific time intervals
- **OverloadWindow**: Identifies periods of sustained capacity overload
- **PeakAnalysis**: Complete analysis results with recommendations
- **CapacityConfig**: Airport-specific capacity configurations
- **WeatherRegime**: Weather condition enumeration affecting capacity

#### 3. Key Features

##### Time Bucketing Functions
- Configurable bucket sizes (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes)
- Automatic bucket creation for entire day (24 hours)
- Flight counting for departures and arrivals
- Delay calculation and hotspot identification

##### Demand vs Capacity Logic
- Real-time capacity calculation based on airport configuration
- Weather impact on runway capacity (calm, medium, strong, severe)
- Time-of-day adjustments (night hours, curfew periods)
- Utilization percentage and overload detection

##### Weather Regime Adjustments
- **Calm**: 100% capacity
- **Medium**: 85% capacity  
- **Strong**: 65% capacity
- **Severe**: 30% capacity
- Automatic capacity scaling based on conditions

##### Peak Detection Algorithms
- Hourly demand aggregation
- Peak hour identification
- Traffic level classification (low, medium, high, critical)
- Overload window detection with severity assessment

##### Heatmap Data Generation
- Color-coded traffic visualization data
- Time-series demand patterns
- Utilization heat mapping
- Multi-day analysis support

#### 4. Airport Configurations
- **Mumbai (BOM)**: 60 flights/hour total capacity
- **Delhi (DEL)**: 70 flights/hour total capacity  
- **Default airports**: 35 flights/hour total capacity
- Customizable capacity configurations per airport

### Testing Implementation

#### Unit Tests (`tests/test_analytics.py`)
- **19 comprehensive test cases** covering all components
- **96% code coverage** on analytics module
- Tests for all data models and algorithms
- Edge case handling and error scenarios

#### Integration Tests (`tests/test_analytics_integration.py`)
- **6 realistic scenario tests** with Mumbai airport data
- Weather impact analysis
- Multi-day heatmap generation
- Custom capacity configuration testing
- Empty time period handling

### Demo Application (`demo_analytics.py`)
- Interactive demonstration of all features
- Realistic Mumbai morning rush hour scenario
- Weather impact comparison
- Heatmap data visualization
- System recommendations display

### Requirements Satisfied

#### Requirement 2.1: Peak Traffic Analysis
✅ **WHEN analyzing flight data THEN the system SHALL generate demand heatmaps in 5-minute or 10-minute buckets**
- Implemented configurable time buckets (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes)
- Generates comprehensive heatmap data structures

#### Requirement 2.2: Overload Detection  
✅ **WHEN demand exceeds capacity THEN the system SHALL highlight overload windows with severity indicators**
- Automatic overload window detection
- Severity classification (minor, moderate, severe)
- Duration and impact metrics

#### Requirement 2.3: Arrival/Departure Analysis
✅ **WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide separate analysis for arrivals and departures**
- Separate counting for departures and arrivals
- Individual delay tracking and analysis
- Combined demand calculation

#### Requirement 2.4: Weather Capacity Adjustments
✅ **WHEN weather conditions change THEN the system SHALL adjust capacity curves accordingly**
- Four weather regime support (calm/medium/strong/severe)
- Automatic capacity scaling based on conditions
- Real-time impact assessment

### Performance Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 96% on analytics module
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% (25/25 tests passing)
- **Processing Speed**: Handles full day analysis (144 buckets) efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures for large datasets

### Key Algorithms Implemented

1. **Peak Detection**: Hourly demand aggregation with peak identification
2. **Overload Window Detection**: Sustained capacity breach identification  
3. **Traffic Level Classification**: Utilization-based severity assessment
4. **Delay Hotspot Analysis**: Time-based delay pattern recognition
5. **Weather Impact Calculation**: Dynamic capacity adjustment algorithms
6. **Recommendation Generation**: Context-aware operational suggestions

### Integration Points
- **Database Service**: Seamless integration with DuckDB flight data
- **Flight Models**: Compatible with existing flight data structures
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible airport capacity settings
- **Visualization Ready**: Heatmap data formatted for dashboard display

### Next Steps
The analytics engine is now ready for integration with:
- Task 6: Delay risk prediction models
