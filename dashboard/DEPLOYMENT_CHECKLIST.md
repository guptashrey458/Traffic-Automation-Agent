2. Configure authentication if required
3. Test API connectivity with sample requests

### 4. Component Integration
1. Link components to main dashboard layout
2. Configure variable bindings between components
3. Set up event handlers and interactions
4. Test component refresh triggers

### 5. Validation Testing
```bash
# Run validation script
node dashboard/validate_dashboard.js

# Expected output: 0 errors, warnings acceptable
```
