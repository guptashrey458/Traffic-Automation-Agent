It combines machine learning, optimization algorithms, and natural language processing to help reduce delays and improve operational efficiency.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Demand Heatmaps**: Visualize traffic patterns and identify capacity bottlenecks\n- **Flight Gantt Charts**: View flight schedules with color-coded delay risk indicators\n- **Optimization Engine**: Generate schedule improvements using constraint-based algorithms\n- **What-If Analysis**: Simulate the impact of schedule changes before implementation\n- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor performance indicators and capacity utilization\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Select your airport and analysis date using the control panel\n2. Review the demand heatmap to identify peak periods\n3. Examine flight schedules in the Gantt chart\n4. Run optimization to generate improvement recommendations\n5. Use what-if analysis to evaluate specific changes"

Start with default weights and adjust based on results\n2. Consider operational priorities (punctuality vs efficiency)\n3. Review constraint violations in optimization results\n4. Use what-if analysis to validate major changes\n5. Monitor CO₂ impact alongside operational metrics"
