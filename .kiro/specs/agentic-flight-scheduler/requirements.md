# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agentic AI Flight Scheduling system is an autonomous intelligent agent that provides real-time flight schedule optimization and delay prevention for busy aviation hubs. Building on comprehensive historical flight data analysis, the system now incorporates live data feeds, weather integration, runway availability monitoring, and weighted graph optimization to deliver continuous autonomous monitoring and proactive schedule adjustments. The system serves as an intelligent co-pilot for airport operations, automatically detecting delay risks, optimizing schedules, and providing real-time recommendations to minimize disruptions across the busiest airports.
