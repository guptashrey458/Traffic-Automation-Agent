simulator = WhatIfSimulator()
impact_card = simulator.analyze_single_flight_change(
    flight_id="AI2509",
    time_change_minutes=-10,  # 10 minutes earlier
    airport="BOM",
    analysis_date=date.today()
)
```

#### Multi-Flight Scenario
```python
scenario = WhatIfScenario(
    scenario_id="peak_optimization",
    description="Optimize peak hour congestion",
    changes=[flight_change1, flight_change2],
    base_date=date.today(),
    airport="BOM"
)
impact_card = simulator.simulate_scenario(scenario)
```

#### Impact Card Export
```python
impact_dict = impact_card.to_dict()
# Returns JSON-ready dictionary for dashboard integration
```
