# Delay Risk Prediction Models - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 6: "Build delay risk prediction models" from the agentic flight scheduler specification. This implementation provides comprehensive delay risk assessment capabilities using both machine learning models (when available) and intelligent fallback heuristics.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. DelayRiskPredictor Class (`src/services/delay_prediction.py`)

**Core Features:**
- **LightGBM Integration**: Binary classification and regression models for delay prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive feature extraction from flight and operational context
- **Dual Prediction**: Both departure and arrival delay risk assessment
- **Fallback System**: Intelligent heuristics when ML models aren't available
- **Model Persistence**: Save/load trained models for production use

**Key Methods:**
- `predict_departure_delay()`: Predicts departure delay probability and expected minutes
- `predict_arrival_delay()`: Predicts arrival delay probability and expected minutes
- `train_models()`: Trains ML models on historical data
- `estimate_turnaround_time()`: P90 turnaround time estimation for same-tail operations
- `predict_taxi_time()`: EXOT/EXIN taxi time predictions

### 2. Data Models

**DelayPrediction:**
- Delay probability (0-1 scale)
- Risk level classification (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Expected delay minutes with confidence intervals
- Key risk factors identification
- Model confidence scoring

**TurnaroundEstimate:**
- P50, P90, P95 turnaround time percentiles
- Feasibility checking for departure slots
- Aircraft type and route type considerations

**OperationalContext:**

- Weather regime impact factors
- Time-based operational factors
- Historical delay context

### 3. Feature Engineering

**Time-based Features:**

### 4. Intelligent Fallback System

When ML models aren't available, the system uses sophisticated heuristics:

**Base Delay Probability Calculation:**
- Airport utilization impact (exponential scaling)
- Weather regime multipliers (calm: 1.0x, severe: 2.5x)
- Peak hour adjustments
- Recent delay propagation

**Airline-specific Adjustments:**
- Air India: 1.2x multiplier (historically higher delays)
- IndiGo: 0.9x multiplier (generally punctual)
- Vistara: 1.1x multiplier
- Default: 1.0x multiplier

**Risk Factor Identification:**
- High utilization warnings (>80%)
- Weather impact assessment
- Peak hour congestion alerts
- Cascade delay risk indicators
